# Machine Learning Project
In this project, I used R to build multiple machine learning models, with the goal of creating one that could accurately predict whether or not an NBA player would make the Hall of Fame based on their player stats. My best model, the random forest one, was able to achieve this with an accuracy of above 95%.
