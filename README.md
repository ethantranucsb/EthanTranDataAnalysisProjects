# Data Analysis Projects by Ethan Tran
In this repository, you can find my completed machine learning, time series, and regression analysis projects. 

## Machine Learning Project
I used R to build multiple machine learning models, with the goal of creating one that could accurately predict whether or not an NBA player would make the Hall of Fame based on their player stats. My best model, the random forest one, was able to achieve this with an accuracy of above 95%.  
The machine learning models sub repository contains the code I used to build the following models: Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, Lasso Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest

## Time Series Project
From a dataset containing daily temperature in Delhi from 2013-2016, I used R to build a time series model to forecast the temperatures in 2018.I performed several transformations on the data such as log transformations and seasonal differencing to create multiple SARIMA models. These were ten tested through autocorrelation and diagnostics analysis to find the best one. When compared with the actual temperatures in Delhi in 2018, my model forecasted with a statistically significant accuracy. 

## Regression Analysis Project
I first cleaned and filtered a dataset containing Mazda listings. I then plotted and analyzed the relationships between variables, such as the negative correlation between car price and mileage. Finally, I built a regression model to predict the price of a Mazda car based on predictors such as mileage, fuel type, fuel consumption, manufacture year, and others. This was all done using R.
