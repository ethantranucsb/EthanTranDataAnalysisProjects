# Data Analysis Projects by Ethan Tran
In this repository, you can find my completed machine learning, time series, and regression analysis projects. 

## Machine Learning Project
I used R to build multiple machine learning models, with the goal of creating one that could accurately predict whether or not an NBA player would make the Hall of Fame based on their player stats. My best model, the random forest one, was able to achieve this with an accuracy of above 95%.
The machine learning models sub repository contains the code I used to create the following models: 

## Time Series Project
From a dataset containing daily temperature in Delhi from 2013-2016, I used R to build a time series model to forecast the temperatures in 2018.I performed several transformations on the data such as log transformations and seasonal differencing to create multiple SARIMA models. These were ten tested through autocorrelation and diagnostics analysis to find the best one. When compared with the actual temperatures in Delhi in 2018, my model forecasted with a statistically significant accuracy. 

## Regression Analysis Project
